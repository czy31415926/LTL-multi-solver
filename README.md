# LTL-multi-solver
It is a general task planer for tasks defined by the linear temporal logic (LTL).

PDT (Planning decision tree) is for the local optimal task plan.
FDT (Filter decision tree) is for the global optimla task plan.

task_test.m, PDT_test.m FDT2_test.m are the main codes. 
You can change the LTL task in the main code, map in map.m, the robot system in Initial_agent.m.
